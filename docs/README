Execution:

The program needs 2 inputs:

./makeover <image_path_name> <glass_path_name> 

where,
<image_path_name> : the path of the image to be operated upon
<glass_path_name> : the path of the glasses image to be placed upon the face

Example Execution:

The sample_run.sh script is a simple script which does the following.
    --- [Cleans the project]
    --- [ compiles the program using the Makefile]
    --- [ Executes the executable on the images in the Data/sample directory]
